1. When a image is set as background , i am not able to add another image , 
reason -  After setting an image as background, new uploads were added but could be behind or not interactable due to stacking and interactivity flags.

Solution - When adding a new image, force it to be interactable and on top and also make Ensure uploaded images are selectable and evented.
Bring newly added image to the front and select it.

cAUSE:Duplicate function was not picking right variable
